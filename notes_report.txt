Linear (2 models)
	2 different architectures
	not so good
Naive convnet (1 model)
	better, but use knowledge of the task (2 images)
	- siamese architecture (not necessarily weight sharing)
Convnet (5 models)
	best, test different training schemes
	- WS & AL (4 models)
	- 2 step transfer learning (using weight sharing) (1 model)


comment on: 
- differences
- convnets inspired by LeNet
- overfitting-> makes no sense to go deeper in convnets
